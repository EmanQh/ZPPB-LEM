# MPC Implementation of Privacy-Preserving Billing for Local Energy Market

This repository contains an implementation of zone-based privacy-preserving billing for the local energy market while considering energy volume deviations of market participants from their bids, as proposed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.08778). The implementation is based on multiparty computation and was tested for three computing parties. The `Billing.mpc` file provides a privacy-preserving billing mechanism that doesn't take participants' locations on the grid into account. In contrast, the `ZoneBasedBilling.mpc` file incorporates users' locations.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the implementation:

1. Download the [Multi-Protocol SPDZ](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ/releases) package and extract its contents.
   
2. Copy the Player-Data folder to the extracted MP-SPDZ folder. 

3. Copy the `Billing.mpc` and `ZoneBasedBilling.mpc` files from this repository to the `Programs/Source` directory within the extracted MP-SPDZ folder.

4. Refer to the [MP-SPDZ Documentation](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io) for detailed instructions on how to run the MPC protocols using the MP-SPDZ software. Choose any of the protocols supported by the MP-SPDZ software to execute `Billing.mpc` and `ZoneBasedBilling.mpc`. 

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or need further assistance.
